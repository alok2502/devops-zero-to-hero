# 🚀 DevOps Zero to Hero Journey

Welcome to my personal DevOps journey!    
I’m on a mission to deeply understand DevOps, build real-world skills.  

---

## 📅 Day 1 – April 9, 2025

### ✅ What I Learned

#### 🔹 What is DevOps?
- DevOps is a **culture** that bridges the gap between development and operations.
- It focuses on **automation**, **quality assurance**, **testing**, and **monitoring**.
- It's not just about faster delivery, but better delivery.

**Simple Definition**:  
> DevOps is a culture to improve delivery by ensuring proper automation, quality, and continuous testing & monitoring.

---

#### 🔹 Why DevOps?
- Traditional SDLC involved multiple roles (Dev, QA, Ops) working in silos.
- Manual efforts caused **slow delivery** and **higher error rates**.
- DevOps eliminates these inefficiencies through **automation and integration**.

---

#### 🔹 SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle
- Phases: Planning → Defining → Designing → Building → Testing → Deployment
- DevOps is mainly concerned with **Build, Test, and Deploy**.
- Goal: Deliver high-quality software **faster and more reliably**.

---

#### 🔹 Virtual Machines & Virtualization
- Real-life analogy: Renting out unused land → improved efficiency.
- In software: Unused server resources → wasted capacity.
- Solution: **Virtualization** using **Hypervisors** to create isolated **Virtual Machines (VMs)**.

Benefits:
- Better utilization of hardware
- Isolation of environments
- Flexibility & scalability

---

#### 🔹 EC2 & Creating VMs
- EC2 = AWS Virtual Machine
- Ways to create EC2:
  - AWS Console (UI)
  - AWS CLI
  - CloudFormation (CFT)
  - CDK
  - Terraform

---

#### 🔹 AWS CLI Basics
- Configured AWS CLI on Linux using `aws configure`
- Used CLI to:
  - Launch EC2
  - List S3 buckets (`aws s3 ls`)

---

#### 🔹 Linux Operating System
- OS = Interface between software and hardware
- Linux is:
  - Free, Open-source, Secure, and Fast
  - Popular in DevOps due to scripting and automation

---

#### 🔹 Linux Architecture
- **Kernel**: Core of OS – manages memory, devices, processes
- **System Libraries**: Help programs interact with the kernel
- **User Space**: Where applications and tools run

---

#### 🔹 Shell & Shell Scripting
- **Shell**: CLI to interact with OS
- **Shell Scripting**: Automate repetitive tasks

---

#### 🔹 Linux Commands Practiced

| Purpose | Command |
|--------|---------|
| List files | `ls` |
| Show directory | `pwd` |
| Navigate | `cd`, `cd ..`, `cd ../..` |
| List by date | `ls -ltr` |
| Create file | `touch filename` |
| Open file | `vi filename` |
| Save & Exit | `:wq!` |
| Read file | `cat filename` |
| Create directory | `mkdir dir` |
| Remove directory | `rm -r dir` |
| Memory info | `free -mg` |
| CPU cores | `nproc` |
| Disk usage | `df -h` |

**File Permissions (chmod):**
- `4` = read
- `2` = write
- `1` = execute
- Example: `chmod 755 filename`
